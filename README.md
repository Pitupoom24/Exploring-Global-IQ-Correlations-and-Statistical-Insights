# Exploring Global IQ: Correlations and Statistical Insights


This project analyzed the "Average Intelligence Quotient (IQ) per Country" dataset to uncover patterns and correlations in average IQ across countries. The dataset revealed an overall average IQ of 82.05, with a maximum of 106.48, a minimum of 42.99, and a standard deviation of 13.34. Data visualization identified significant correlations between average IQ and factors such as mean years of schooling, the Human Development Index (HDI), and literacy rate, while factors like Gross National Income (GNI), Nobel Prizes, and population size showed weak or no correlation. To validate the relationship between average IQ and mean years of schooling, a one-tailed two-sample hypothesis test was conducted, comparing countries with 10â€“15 years of schooling to others. The resulting p-value of 1.3715e-24 confirmed that the observed differences are statistically significant, demonstrating that higher mean years of schooling are associated with higher average IQ.
